# Parkineer
A simple 3D isometric game based on Roller Coaster Tycoon and Parkitect for Game Design at Rutgers University.

This stripped-down version of the game allows you to wander around the map and places a few objects onto the grid. It's more of the sandbox engine than gameplay.

Currently, there are the following objects: Ferris Wheel, Wall, Wall Cornerstone, Fence, Corner Fence, and a path tile.
